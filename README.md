# This project comes from the work done by https://github.com/AndrejGobeX/TrackMania_AI

I modified this project to train a RL AI in TrackMania Nations Forever using the NEAT algorithm.
The functions that remains are the screen computing and part of the implementation of the NEAT algorithm.

# TrackMania_AI
Neural network driver for Trackmania
## Intro and goals
Computer vision and self-driving cars are one of the most common topics in ML/AI nowadays. As I am new in the ML/AI world, I wanted to experiment and play with AI cars.
I played Trackmania when I was young and figured that it could be a good environment for this project.\
My goal here is to implement the NEAT algorithm to trackmania and at term to creat an AI that can have human capabilities at beating TMNF.

## Contents
All the scripts contain instructions for arguments, running, etc. so read them before playing.
